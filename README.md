# Travel Market Segmentation & Pricing Strategy  
End-to-End Market Research & Statistical Analytics Case Study

##  Business Problem
A startup travel agency aims to enter a competitive digital market by designing differentiated travel packages for young professionals.  
The objective was to determine:
- Who the target customer is  
- How much they are willing to spend  
- What drives booking behaviour  
- Whether demographic segmentation is effective  
- How pricing and channel strategy should be structured  

A structured survey dataset (n = 250, population ≈ 2,500) was designed and analysed using inferential statistical methods to inform strategic decisions.

## Methodology

- Survey design & structured data simulation  
- Stratified random sampling with weighted estimation  
- Descriptive statistics  
- Confidence interval estimation  
- One-way and Two-way ANOVA  
- Chi-square test of independence  
- Pearson correlation analysis  
- Welch two-sample t-test  
- Interaction effect modelling  
- Correlation matrix analysis  

## Key Analytical Findings

### 1. Target Market Profile
- Mean age: 28.78 years (95% CI: 27.88–29.68)  
- Mean planned spending: AUD $9,145 (95% CI: $8,175–$10,115)  
- Spending distribution positively skewed → premium segment identified  

### 2. Demographics Do Not Drive Spending
- No significant spending differences across age groups (ANOVA: p = 0.456)  
- No significant Age × Gender interaction effect  
- Age not associated with communication channel preference (Chi-square: p = 0.18)  

**Insight:** Demographic-based segmentation is ineffective.

### 3. Behavioural Segmentation Is More Valuable
- Destination preferences evenly distributed  
- Service importance ratings largely independent  
- Flexibility importance not significantly correlated with spending  

**Insight:** Multi-dimensional behavioural segmentation outperforms age-based targeting.

### 4. Digital-First Booking Behaviour
- Mobile apps and direct websites dominate booking channels  
- Traditional agents remain relevant for complex bookings  

**Insight:** A hybrid distribution model is required.

### 5. AI Features Do Not Increase Spending
- No significant spending difference based on interest in AI tools  

**Insight:** AI should enhance customer experience rather than be positioned as a premium upsell.
